### Data Provided

When the preliminary competition opens, the teams will be able to download the
required data to start building their algorithms. The data are:

1) HPPC Data (Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization): a set of discharge-charge pulses, applied to a battery at different states of charge (SOC) and at a given temperature.
2) OCV SOC Data (Open Circuit Voltage vs. State of Charge): Provide the needed data set to implement relationship between the SOC and OCV
3) Real Operation Data: Define real operational scenarios, including the real SoC values under different load profiles.

Goal:
Develop an algorithm for Optimization: Try to minimize the the error between the
estimated SOC and the real SOc on the real operation data


The evaluation criteria will include:
1)Maximum Absolute Error (MaxAE): Measuring the largest absolute error in state of charge estimation.
2) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Assessing the overall accuracy of the algorithm by calculating the square root of the mean squared errors.
3) Calculation Efficiency: Evaluating the computational efficiency and speed of the algorithm.
4) Transient Convergence: Assessing how quickly and accurately the algorithm converges during transient conditions.
5) Documentation and Presentation: Judging the clarity and thorough

### Research
$\text{SoC}(t) = \frac{Q_{\text{remaining}}(t)}{Q_{\text{max}}(t)} \times 100 \, \%$ \
$\text{SOC} = \text{SOC}_0 + \frac{1}{C_N} \int_0^t I_{\text{batt}} \, dt$
There will be internal battery looses and other things that come into play too

### Approach
Create a function from HPPC and OCV data whose input takes current and a timestamps from 0 to until that point of time and outputs SOC . can be trained to optimise with real world data too.
